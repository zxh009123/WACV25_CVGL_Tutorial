##### Abstract:
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have gained significant attention for their ability to capture high-quality multimedia data from aerial perspectives. As multimedia applications like aerial photography, cinematography, and mapping, UAVs have become essential tools for gathering diverse and rich content. This talk will explore the latest advancements, challenges, and opportunities in the field of UAV multimedia, including aerial image and video processing, machine learning for UAV data analysis, swarm technology, and UAV-based multimedia applications such as cross-view geo-localization.
