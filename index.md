{% include figure.html img="teaser.png" alt="intro image here" width="100%" %}


##### Tutorial Description:
The availability of geospatial data from diverse sources and perspectives has expanded rapidly in recent years, unlocking opportunities across various fields. Cross-view geo-localization—matching ground images with aerial or satellite views to pinpoint geographical locations—has become a critical area of research due to its diverse applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality. Despite substantial advancements, this field faces significant challenges, including handling extreme viewpoint variations, reliability, and integration of multimodal information across diverse perspectives. Recent developments in Generative AI (GenAI), including Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), have introduced more generalized approaches to incorporate multimodality data. These advancements not only enhance performance but also redefine how multimodality is utilized in real-world settings. As the field evolves rapidly, this tutorial offers an ideal opportunity for researchers—especially those new to the domain—to grasp the latest methodologies, explore cutting-edge datasets, and understand emerging trends that will shape the future of cross-view geo-localization.
